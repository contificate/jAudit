College Graded Unit Project

---
### Results
The Graded Unit is composed of 3 stages; the planning, development, and evaluation stages.

Planning | Development | Evaluation | Overall
--- | --- | --- | --- |
31 | 40 | 20 | 91
 | | | | 91% = A

This was my Graded Unit Project as part of my Software Development HND at college.

The idea was to allow auditing of Java code that stored references to AST structures and then produce reports from them.

From this project, I was hoping to implement certain constraint satisfiability visitation problems to automatically lint source code. On a similar note, I also wanted to write an interactive, graphically-driven CFG designer that would recognise patterns in graph-drawn productions to help language designers (using the naive algorithm referenced in https://fit.cvut.cz/sites/default/files/PhDThesis_Flouri.pdf - ~~until I can understand the better algorithm the author proposed~~).

Note: I dislike all of this project, apart from the documentation.
